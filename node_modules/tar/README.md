# node-tar

Fast and full-featured Tar for Node.js

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of `tar(1)` on unix systems.
If you are familiar with how tar works, most of this will hopefully be
straightforward for you.  If not, then hopefully this module can teach
you useful unix skills that may come in handy someday :)

## Background

A "tar file" or "tarball" is an archive of file system entries
(directories, files, links, etc.)  The name comes from "tape archive".
If you run `man tar` on almost any Unix command line, you'll learn
quite a bit about what it can do, and its history.

Tar has 5 main top-level commands:

* `c` Create an archive
* `r` Replace entries within an archive
* `u` Update entries within an archive (ie, replace if they're newer)
* `t` List out the contents of an archive
* `x` Extract an archive to disk

The other flags and options modify how this top level function works.

## High-Level API

These 5 functions are the high-level API.  All of them have a
single-character name (for unix nerds familiar with `tar(1)`) as well
as a long name (for everyone else).

All the high-level functions take the following arguments, all three
of which are optional and may be omitted.

1. `options` - An optional object specifying various options
2. `paths` - An array of paths to add or extract
3. `callback` - Called when the command is completed, if async.  (If
   sync or no file specified, providing a callback throws a
   `TypeError`.)

If the command is sync (ie, if `options.sync=true`), then the
callback is not allowe
